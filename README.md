This project has two scripts. 

The first is for a set of bank data called "PyBank". This script opens a csv file from the directory. It then uses for loops, lists, functions, and conditionals to calculate the total number of months in the data set, the net total of the entire period, the average of changes in profit/loss, the month and percent for the greatest increase in profits, and the month and percent for the greatest decrease in profits. Finally, it creates a csv for the data found.
The second script is for a set of data called "PyPoll" This script opens a csv file from the directory. It then uses for loops and conditionals to find how many votes were cast, how many votes and percent of the total votes each candidate won, and the winner of the election. Finally, it creates a csv file for the data found.
